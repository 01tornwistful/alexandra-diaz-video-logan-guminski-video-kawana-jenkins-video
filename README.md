Kawana Jenkins, a former detention officer at the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office, is facing serious charges for engaging in sexual misconduct with an inmate.

After a contraband cellphone video of her engaging in explicit acts with the inmate came to light, Jenkins was terminated from her position and subsequently arrested.

She now faces a total of 13 charges, including two counts of improper sexual contact, five counts of violation of oath, two counts of reckless conduct, two counts of cruelty to inmates, and one count of providing an inmate with an unauthorized item.

The video in question shows Jenkins, still in uniform, seated in a chair as a man’s fingers enter the frame.  Jenkins then proceeds to simulate a sexual act on the fingers before the video concludes.


This week, Jenkins appeared in court for the first time and was granted bond by the judge.

ATLANTA, GA — A former Fulton County detention officer is facing at least a dozen charges after she was accused of displaying inappropriate behavior with a male inmate caught on video, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said in a news release Wednesday.

Kawana Jenkins, 36, was terminated and arrested Monday on suspicion of two counts of improper sexual contact by employee or agent, five counts of violation of oath by a public officer, two counts of reckless conduct, two counts of cruelty to inmates and one count of obtain/procure/give inmate prohibited items without authorization, authorities said.

The incident was videotaped on a contraband cellphone that was seized during a shakedown at the Fulton County Jail, authorities said. It was later confirmed Jenkins was the person on the video, authorities said.

She had been employed with the sheriff's office since December 2019, authorities said.

“As sheriff of Fulton County, I am committed to transparency and to holding each and
every employee accountable to (the) oath they have taken to protect and serve our community," Fulton County Sheriff Patrick “Pat” Labat said in the release. “The actions of this one individual are certainly not a reflection of the men and women of the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office. The vast majority of employees are to be commended for their integrity, commitment to service and the work they do day in and day out.”
